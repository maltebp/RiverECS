Left off at:
    Testing SignatureArray, and then implement creation of entities in Domain 


General:



    ☐ Create pre-allocated array of entities instead of doing dynamic allocation each time
    ☐ Allow user to set number of component types to preallocate
    ☐ Clean ComponentControllers frequently by sorting components according to entity id
    ☐ Cache queries
    ☐ Clean up domain properly (i.e. destroy componentcontrollers))
    ☐ Change SignatureArray to handle larger bit indices (change unsigned int to size_t)


    Tests:
        ☐ Create and destroy entity in same cycle
        ✔ Test resizing of signatures
        ☐ SignatureArray
