Left off at:
    Just finished implementing special case for single component queries (and its working)
    Fix bug stated below
    Note that lists are not cleaned in the Domain.clean()


General:


    ☐ ERROR: If a entities are queried with components, which hasn't been created yet, it crashes (just make sure component is added before creating search signature)
    ☐ Create pre-allocated array of entities instead of doing dynamic allocation each time
    ☐ Allow user to set number of component types to preallocate
    ☐ Clean ComponentControllers frequently by sorting components according to entity id
    ☐ Cache signature queries (in SignatureArray)
    ☐ Clean up domain properly (i.e. destroy componentcontrollers))
    ☐ Change SignatureArray to handle larger bit indices (change unsigned int to size_t)


    Tests:
        ☐ Create and destroy entity in same cycle
        ✔ Test resizing of signatures
        ☐ Query entities with components, which no entity has yet
