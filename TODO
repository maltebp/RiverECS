Left off at:
    Just finished implementing the creation and deletion of components in the Domain.
    Currently NOT working, so needs to be fixed and tested THOROUGHLY
    Note that lists are not cleaned in the Domain.clean()


General:



    ☐ Create pre-allocated array of entities instead of doing dynamic allocation each time
    ☐ Allow user to set number of component types to preallocate
    ☐ Clean ComponentControllers frequently by sorting components according to entity id
    ☐ Cache queries
    ☐ Clean up domain properly (i.e. destroy componentcontrollers))
    ☐ Change SignatureArray to handle larger bit indices (change unsigned int to size_t)


    Tests:
        ☐ Create and destroy entity in same cycle
        ✔ Test resizing of signatures
        ☐ SignatureArray
